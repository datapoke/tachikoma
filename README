Welcome!

This is the official distribution for Tachikoma.

Tachikoma is a message based distributed computing platform.
Written entirely in Perl, the performance is quite good, with
the Apache Kafka-inspired hub able to handle millions of messages
every second.  It is highly reliable and has been used in a
production environment for over 10 years.

To get started, follow the instructions in the file INSTALL.

Then:

  tachikoma-server
  tachikoma-client

At the prompt, type "help" for a list of possible commands.
You might want to start with "connect server_log".

Unfortunately there is not yet much documentation, but some additional
information is available in the following manual pages:

    perldoc Tachikoma::Node
    perldoc Tachikoma

Have fun with your new Tachikoma!
