Welcome!

This is the official distribution for Tachikoma.

Tachikoma is a message based distributed computing platform.
Written entirely in Perl, the performance is quite good, with
the Apache Kafka-inspired hub able to handle millions of messages
every second.  It is highly reliable and has been used in a
production environment for over 10 years.

To get started:

    git clone https://github.com/datapoke/tachikoma
    cd tachikoma
    sudo -u docker docker-compose up -d
    sudo -u docker docker-compose exec -u tachikoma tachikoma1 tachikoma-client

At the prompt, type "help" for a list of possible commands.
The default config (etc/scripts/default/startup.txt) describes an in-memory
key/value store with persistent storage.

In tachikoma-client, try the command:

    connect access_log

In a separate terminal, POST something to the server:

    curl --data-binary @Pictures/IMG001.JPG -X POST \
        http://localhost:4242/store/topic1/IMG001.JPG

Then you can fetch the value here:

    http://localhost:4242/topic1:table/DSCN1032.JPG

You can also get a list of keys in JSON format here:

    http://localhost:4242/topic1:table

Or a list of topics here:

    http://localhost:4242/

Unfortunately there is not yet much documentation, but some additional
information is available in the following manual pages:

    perldoc Tachikoma::Node
    perldoc Tachikoma

Have fun with your new Tachikoma!
